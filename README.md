# Matrix Bot for sending homeserver invitation link via e-mail

A early stage and simlpe Matrix bot which I use in addition to [matrix-registration](https://github.com/ZerataX/matrix-registration).

The bot calls the Api and sends the invitation link via e-mail to a given receipient.

## Usage

Use container image or run this after cloning: 

```
. bin/active
python -m matrix_bot_invitation_mailer
```
